## 🧠 About the Project

This project focuses on analyzing bike-sharing systems to understand **how**, **when**, and **where** bikes are used.  
By exploring usage frequency, peak demand hours, and behavioral trends, we aim to improve system efficiency and ensure balanced bike distribution across locations.

## 🌟 Core Objectives

✔ Identify usage patterns (time-based + location-based)  
✔ Detect peak demand periods & user behavior  
✔ Suggest improvements for bike allocation  
✔ Enhance availability & overall system experience

## 🔧 How the System Works

🟢 **Step 1 — Data Loading**  
‣ Imported raw bike-sharing datasets  
‣ Initial exploration & structure overview  

🟢 **Step 2 — Cleaning & Preparation**  
‣ Removed duplicates, handled missing values  
‣ Converted timestamps and extracted features: *hour, month, season, weekday...*

🟢 **Step 3 — Feature Engineering**  
‣ Added attributes for pattern recognition  
‣ Compared demand across timeframes  

🟢 **Step 4 — Visual Analytics & Insights**  
‣ Graphs reveal activity spikes + low usage windows  
‣ Understanding seasonality and location trends  

🟢 **Step 5 — Recommendations & Results**  
‣ Improve allocation strategies during rush hours  
‣ Increase bikes in high-demand clusters
